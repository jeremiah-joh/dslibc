Binary search tree
==================

Unbalanced, plain binary search tree.

Initialization
--------------

You can initialize a binary search tree with following macros.

* INIT_BST(name, key_t, val_t, cmp);
* INIT_BST_TYPE(name, key_t, val_t);
* INIT_BST_FUNC(name, key_t, val_t, cmp);

Each parpameters have following meanings.

* 'name' is the name of data structure. it is represented as 'struct bst_name'.
* 'key_t' is a type of key.
* 'val_t' is a type of value.
* 'cmp' is a function that compares two key and returns signed integer.
it should returns negative integer if the first key is less than second,
positive if the first key is greater than second,
and zero if both keys have same value.
